# Prerequisites

Lets take a random malware. You can get the files from this [link](https://github.com/cr-0w/analysis/tree/main/homework/easy/ultima).

Since NAT is host only, so we need to have a shared malware folder b/w our Host and VM. For that `VM Settings > Options > Shared Folder > Enabled until next power off or suspend` .

After putting path of folder, make it

Now you will find the shared folder in VM along the Path - `File Explorer > Network > vm-host > Shared Folder`

Now download the malware “zip(.7z)”. Move it to the folder in host (which has been shared). After this in the vm create another folder at desktop and copy the stuff from shared folder to the desktop folder. Unzip the file.
