I am Anmol Vats. I am a Cybersecurity enthusiast, always reading up or trying to find vulnerabilities in everyday software. I'll be graduating from [The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur](https://lnmiit.ac.in/) (LNMIIT) in Computer Science in 2025.

I worked at [Safe Security](https://safe.security/) where I spearheaded the comprehensive documentation of [RiskLens](https://docs.risklens.com/), completing the project in half the allotted time. This critical task held top priority following the acquisition of RiskLens by Safe. I contributed extensively in the CTI domain, enhancing security posture through proactive analysis and intelligence sharing and successfully completed exclusive training in CompTIA Security+, MITRE ATT\&CK Certifications and Python.

I was the Club Coordinator of Cipher (The Blockchain and Cybersecurity club of LNMIIT) from 2023 â€“2024. I co-founded HacksCTF series (Annual Inter-college CTF hosted by Cipher, LNMIIT at a National Level ) back in 2023 and co-founded LNMIIT Official CTF Team [u3fi](https://ctftime.org/team/217084).

This book started out as an article for my [blog](https://medium.com/@anmolvats220703). Eventually, a lot of matter filled in and it transformed into a short book. These are a collection of my notes, gathered by looking up various online resources regarding Malware - Development and Analysis.
