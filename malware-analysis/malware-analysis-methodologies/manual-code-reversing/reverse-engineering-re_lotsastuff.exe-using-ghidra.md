# Reverse Engineering re\_lotsastuff.exe Using Ghidra

**1. Setting Up Ghidra:**

* **Create a New Project:**
  * Open Ghidra and create a new project.
  * **Import the Sample:**
    * Drag and drop the `re_lotsastuff.exe` sample into the project or press **I** on the keyboard to import it.

**2. Analyzing the File:**

* **Open in Default Tool:**
  * After importing, right-click the sample and select **Open in Default Tool** to begin the analysis.
  * Follow the dialogues and choose the options that allow Ghidra to analyze the file.

**3. Navigating the Disassembly and Decompiled Code:**

* **Symbol Tree Navigation:**
  * In the left pane, expand the **Symbol Tree** under the **Functions** folder.
  * Look for the **entry function** to begin your analysis.
* **Viewing Decompiled Code:**
  * Clicking on the entry function will bring up both the disassembled code and the decompiled version of the code in the right pane.
* **Finding the Main Function:**
  * To locate the main function:
    * Use the address identified in IDA Pro (in this case, **0x401480**).
    * Search within the **Symbol Tree** for functions prefixed with `FUN_` followed by an underscore and the relevant address.
    * This brings up the main function in a more readable, decompiled view.

**4. Ghidra Plugins:**

* **Exploration of Plugins:**
  * Ghidra has a variety of plugins that can aid in analyzing files more efficiently.
  * It's recommended to explore and utilize these plugins to enhance the speed and accuracy of your analysis.

**5. Key Takeaways:**

* **Ghidra’s Strengths:**
  * Provides both disassembly and a high-level decompiled view, making it easier to understand the code.
  * Symbol Tree helps in quick navigation to critical functions like the main function.
* **Plugin Support:**
  * Leverage the available plugins in Ghidra to improve your analysis workflow.
* **Learning Resources:**
  * The course series includes sessions on assembly language, which can be beneficial if you're new to low-level programming.

These notes cover the fundamental steps for using Ghidra to analyze and decompile a C++ compiled 32-bit executable. Ghidra’s combination of disassembly and decompiled views, along with its plugins, make it a powerful tool for reverse engineering.
