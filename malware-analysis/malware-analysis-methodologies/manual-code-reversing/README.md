# Manual Code Reversing

**1. Context of Malware Analysis:**

* **Dynamic Analysis Challenges:** Encountered a situation where dynamic analysis yielded no useful information. The malware appeared inactive during analysis.
* **Static Analysis Observations:** Identified the file as a Windows PE executable with obfuscated code and data, characterized by the absence of text strings.

**2. Manual Code Reversing Process:**

* **Debugging with X86 Debugger:**
  * Used an X86 debugger to reverse engineer the code.
  * Discovered that the malware required a specific command line argument to activate its behavior, which was not evident through dynamic analysis alone.

**3. Importance of Understanding Low-Level Language:**

* **X86 Assembly Language:** Essential for debugging Windows executable files, particularly in Windows 10 environments using X86 or X64 architecture.
* **Windows APIs & C Syntax:** Knowledge of these is crucial for effective debugging and understanding the malware's behavior at a deeper level.

**4. Recommended Tools for Code Reversing:**

* **IDA Pro with Hex-Rays Decompiler:**
  * A commercial tool for disassembly and decompilation.
  * Converts binary executables into human-readable code, often in C language syntax.
* **Other Useful Tools:**
  * **dnSpy:** For decompiling .NET compiled executables.
  * **Ghidra:** An alternative tool with decompilation features, suitable for various binary formats.

**5. Decompilers Overview:**

* **Purpose:** Convert binary executables into readable code, often showing C language syntax.
* **Types of Executables:**
  * Some executables are compiled into byte code or pseudo code, which can be decompiled back to source code.
* **Examples:**
  * **dnSpy** for .NET executables.
  * **Java Archive Decompilers** for Java executables.
  * **Hex-Rays** for general binary-to-C decompilation.

**6. Practical Application:**

* **Debugging Demonstration:** The importance of using both a debugger (e.g., X64 debugger) and a decompiler on compiled executables, especially for deeper analysis when traditional methods fall short.
