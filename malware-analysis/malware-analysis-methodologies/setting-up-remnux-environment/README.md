# Setting Up REMnux Environment

**Tools and Software Setup:**

1. **REMnux**:
   * REMnux is a specialized Linux distribution designed for malware analysis.
   * Version: REMnux v7.
   * The appliance is available for download from the official REMnux website.
2. **Virtual Machine Guest Tools Installation**:
   * **VirtualBox**:
     * Click on **Devices** in the VirtualBox menu.
     * Select **Insert Guest Additions CD Image**.
     * Run the installer to install the guest tools.
   * **VMware or Other VM Hosting Software**:
     * Check the respective documentation to install the guest tools.
   * **Credentials**:
     * Username: `remnux`
     * Password: `malware`
   * **Post Installation**:
     * Restart the operating system.
     * Enable **Drag and Drop** and **Clipboard Sharing**.
     * Test these features by dragging and dropping files (e.g., course archives) into a folder.
3. **Extracting Course Files**:
   *   Use the `7z` command-line tool to extract course files:

       ```bash
       bashCopy code7z e re_nonmalware_samples.7z -oRE_nonmalware_samples
       ```
   * Extract the files into the folder `RE_nonmalware_samples`.
4. **IDA Freeware Installation**:
   * Download the Linux version of IDA Freeware from the Hex-Rays website.
   * The installation package is a `.run` file.
   * **Installation Steps**:
     * Open a terminal in the folder where the IDA Freeware was downloaded.
     *   Grant execute permissions to the installer using `chmod`:

         ```bash
         bashCopy codechmod +x idafree.run
         ```
     * Run the installer to install IDA Free.
   * **Shortcut Configuration**:
     * A shortcut for IDA Free is stored in the `Desktop` folder.
     * To make it globally accessible, move the shortcut to the shared applications folder.
5. **Setting Up FakeNet**:
   * **FakeNet**: A network simulation tool that is useful for analyzing how malware interacts with the network.
   * Run FakeNet with root privileges using `sudo`.
   * **Common Issue**:
     * If you encounter an error related to DNS port (Port 53) already being used, the `systemd-resolved` service might be the cause.
   * **Solution**:
     *   Disable the `systemd-resolved` service:

         ```bash
         bashCopy codesudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
         sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
         ```
     * Edit the Network Manager configuration file (`/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`):
       *   Add the following line under the `[main]` section:

           <pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>bashCopy codedns=default
           </strong></code></pre>
       * Save and exit the editor.
     *   Restart the Network Manager service:

         ```bash
         bashCopy codesudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
         ```
   * **Verification**:
     *   Run the `lsof` command to ensure that Port 53 is free:

         ```bash
         bashCopy codesudo lsof -i :53
         ```
     * FakeNet should now run smoothly.
6. **Final Step**:
   * Take a snapshot of the VM state, which includes the configured REMnux environment and the course files, to preserve the setup for future analysis.

These notes cover the essential steps to set up the REMnux environment for ELF analysis, including installing necessary tools and configuring network settings for smooth operation.
